# Alfaromeo Giulia-Stelvio PIDs and CarScanner export

This space have the purpose to share the parameters I've collected and experimented on my Alfaromeo Giulia 2.2mjtd MY2016.
Some parameters are found around most famous alfa forums (mainly https://www.giuliaforums.com/ and https://www.alfaowner.com/ ), and the most part are from a personal reverse engineering long term project.

Here you can find a simple excel table with the list, and a direct impport file for CarScanner app (the one I usually use).
